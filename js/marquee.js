         "Oh, now you've gone and done it. You may not realize it, but you have stumbled upon a horror unlike anything you have ever faced before, one that wouldn't occur to you even in your wildest dreams. It is...\n\n...a boring scroll of text with a prize at the end of it that you'll most likely feel compelled to get and therefore sit through the whole thing.\n\nSo, well, okay, I guess it's not that horrific. You can exit at any time, using that lovely Back button in your browser or any of the links on my menu. In fact, that's kind of the point: knowing that you have a reward waiting for you, will you leave in the knowledge that you are forfeiting your reward, or will you endure till the end? Are you patient enough to withstand all the mind-numbing rambling in here and claim your prize?\n\nThere are obvious routes of cheating with this setup, of course - you could just put the marquee on, go do something else while it runs in the background, and then get the prize when it's run to the end. To prevent this, the prize is only available for a short period. The text of the marquee will clearly indicate when you can get the prize and how, if you are reading it, but if you're not actually reading it, that section will probably just scroll on by and you will miss the prize.\n\nI see you haven't left yet (or, more accurately, if you had you wouldn't be seeing this), so without further ado, prepare to <face the Marquee>.",
        "Aaaaand you stayed! Marvellous. Oh, what fun we shall have. By which, of course, I mean what fun I shall have trying to compel you to turn back and leave.\n\nLet's start off on a Pokémon-related note, what with this being a Pokémon website and all. Remember the Team Rocket motto from the anime? If you don't, it goes like this:\n\nPrepare for trouble...\nMake it double!\nTo protect the world from devastation;\nto unite all peoples within our nation!\nTo denounce the evils of truth and love;\nto extend our reach to the stars above!\nJessie!\nJames!\nTeam Rocket blast off at the speed of light!\nSurrender now, or prepare to fight!\nMeowth, that's right!\n\nSo where am I going with this? Well, the Pokemon TV show has been translated to numerous languages around the world. \n\nIn the Icelandic dub of the Pokémon anime, the Team Rocket motto went like this:\n\nVandi...\nMikill vandi!\nSvo heimurinn eyðist ekki í bráð,\nþá heimtum við tafarlaust heimsyfirráð!\nOkkur er sama um sannleika og ást;\nað síðustu skal okkar takmark nást!\nJessie!\nJames!\nTeam Rocket klíkan fer um fljótt,\nog sigrar óvini sína skjótt!\nMjá, einmitt!\n\nLiterally translated by my dear Icelandic pen pal, that means something like this:\n\nTrouble...\nLots of trouble!\nSo the world won't be destroyed for a while,\nwe demand world domination immediately!\nWe don't care about truth and love;\nin the end we will reach our goal!\nJessie!\nJames!\nThe Team Rocket gang goes around quickly,\nand defeats its enemies fast!\nMeow, exactly!\n\nIt rhymes, but the rhythm doesn't entirely match up.. So what was the point of this? Nothing, really. There's no real point in anything here. It's just me rambling inanely about everything that pops into my head, and this section has hopefully given you a taste of what that looks like. Feel like leaving yet?",
        "I originally made this marquee in 2008 or so, when I was considerably zanier and more immature than I am today, and one of the most illustrative things I put in the original marquee was the following story: Once upon a time, there was a hairbrush that decided it would be best to abandon humanity and retreat to the woods with its faithful friend, the Internet. Of course, no one cared that the hairbrush was gone, but because the Internet was gone, no one could help dancing the macarena on top of a phoenix and singing the national anthem...\n\n...and then, of course, I abandoned the story and gleefully recited the lyrics of the  national anthem. I think I won't this time around, but I'm very tempted to. This marquee is like a big childhood nostalgia trip for me, remembering all the silly things that I thought up to push my poor website visitors to their limits. Unfortunately for you, who don't experience my nostalgia (unless you used to visit this website way back when, in which case you're pretty awesome), most of this is likely just tiresome - but then again, isn't that the point of this whole exercise?\n",
        "Well. Now, you should have been reading this marquee for something like ten minutes, at least if it's running at the same speed as for me, but I'm sure it felt like half an hour - it did to me when I was testing this. Are you feeling tempted to leave yet? No? Oh, well. I'll just have to continue, then.\n\n\"The honour of rediscovering the effect of these medicines on regular heartbeat goes not to a doctor but a layman, as unknown as the old woman who got Withering on the right track. One day in 1912, a man entered Karl Wenckebach's office in Vienna and complained about abnormal heartbeat. His name is not disclosed in any files. Dr. Wenckebach examined the patient, but concluded he couldn't promise to be any help at all. The man then said he could heal this himself.\"\n\nIf that seems cryptic to you, it should. It's a passage from a book on the history of medicine, another thing that's been here since the first version of this marquee, and I don't think I have any idea today what the context of it was. It would be amusing to dig up that book and find the passage; originally I just flipped to a random page and typed up the first paragraph I found.\n\nI did a similar thing later, this time picking up the nearest book in English I found. It turned out to be <The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants>, a book which I was given as a present sometime but never read (and still haven't read to this day). It came with a musing on how I tend to like girly things and how that made it a good way to scare off opossite-minded people. Instead of doing that now, here's a little PSA: It's okay to like girly things. It's okay not to like girly things. It's okay to like girly or not like girly things if you're a boy, or if you're a girl, or if you're neither. It's okay to like anything you want if you're not harming other people by it, and people should stop judging each other for tastes and preferences that harm no one. And this has been your public service announcement for today. Thank you and good night.",
        "Okay, a bit more about languages. One of the things that fascinates me is how one can express something in one language but never express precisely the same nuance in the other. Sure, you might be able to say <kind of> the same thing, but the words are going to have subtly different connotations and feelings associated with them and generally even if you find a pretty good equivalence, there will be a slight difference, perhaps just in how the words sound, that makes them not quite the same. Over the years I've grown to be kind of suspicious of translations - with a competent translator you can trust the words to really mean what they're translated as, but I always have a paranoid sense that nuance is being lost. That isn't to say a translated work can't be good in its own right, but it's not quite the <same> work.\n\nIt's not just language, even; all communication works this way. Even if the words themselves are identical, two people can deliver the same sentence with subtly different emphases and inflections that render them completely different in meaning. Remaking a movie will give you an ever so slightly different movie, even if you're very faithful to the original, and when adapting work in another medium, the problem is even worse. Heck, look at two emojis from different emoji sets and marvel at how they appear to be expressing slightly different emotions even though some company has decided they're an appropriate replacement for the same plain text smilie. (On my forums, I expressly decided not to make the graphical emoticons replace standard textual emoticons, simply because replacing what you typed with a graphic is changing the emotion being expressed, however subtly.)\n\nI may be getting a bit pretentious here, but in the book <1984> by George Orwell, part of the plot involves the totalitarian government's plan to construct a new language, Newspeak, where concepts of revolt or civil unrest simply don't exist: every word is rigorously defined to simply not mean anything that could breed rebellion, avoiding connotations and nuance in favor of static, sterile definitions. It's an interesting idea - while people could <feel> the same emotions as they do today, they would be unable to express any part of them in words, which would probably seriously hinder any organized revolution. At the same time, it seems to me words would always pick up connotations and people would find new ways to express things.",

        "...you're <still alive>? I admire you; I really do. Chances are you've been reading this for about twenty-five minutes now at the least. Is your patience being tested yet?\n\nI've always liked to write stories, even before I got into Pokémon and started writing ridiculously long fanfiction. Most of them were fantasy of some kind. One of them involved a creature called a pterodacteagle--it looked like a pterodactyl but for no good reason had eagle wings. Its modus operandi was to lie in wait above dragons' nests for an opportunity to steal and eat the eggs, and it was so patient that it would frequently starve to death waiting if the parents never went away for long enough. So, the point of this whole detour was to tell you that you're fast approaching pterodacteagle levels of patience, which is somewhat worrying - I'd rather you didn't starve to death reading this.\n\nWhile we're talking about stories I wrote, I'm going to run with that for my next attempt to drive you off. Here's the prologue of the IALCOTN version of my friend's lovely fanfiction <The Quest for the Legends>. (I would give you something from <Morphic>, but that's considerably less kid-friendly than this marquee is aiming for.) It is very experimental, written in a weird blend of past and present tense, nothing like the style of the actual fic, and doesn't make much sense on its own. You sure you don't want to just leave before I start?\n\nAwakening. Heavy eyelids retract with difficulty, slowly, weakly. The deep blue eyes behind them adjust their focus to the cloudy sky above.\n\n<It did not know where it was, but it could tell that it was lying down.>\n\n<It also knew that the sky had been clear last time it saw it.>\n\nThe creature’s small pink paws feel the damp soil underneath them. It moves them, trembling, up into its line of vision, and the eyes refocus.\n\n<Blood dripped slowly from the raised paw onto the fur on its chest, but what did it matter? It was all stained red already.>\n\nIt blinks.\n\n<There was not supposed to be blood. There was no blood in its last conscious memory.>\n\nIt squeezes its eyes firmly shut again and pushes itself shakily to its elongated feet, but then hesitates.\n\n<It did not really want to look. It feared what it might see, what more horror its eyes would be forced to absorb.>\n\n<But it had to.>\n\nThe creature’s chest expands and contracts. It opens a small rift between its eyelids.\n\n<Fire, death, destruction.>\n\nIts eyes snap open.\n\nIt is standing beside the body of a larger creature with pale, leathery skin, bulgy fingers and toes and a long, thick, violet tail.\n\n<It did not recognize him, but thought no more of it in the horror of the moment.>\n\nThe last remaining houses of a human village burn in front of a forest of dead, leafless trees. The former inhabitants, humans and Pokémon, lie sprawled on the ground, some dead, some dying, some mutilated beyond recognition, but none conscious. It notices the torn corpse of a black creature with glowing, green markings lying a short distance away.\n\n<It sensed the cool wind ruffle its fur. It suddenly seemed so cold…>\n\n<It felt around with telepathy in despair, but there was no response signal; the only sound to be heard was the crackling of the fire as it devoured the last remains of the village.>\n\nThe creature closes its large eyes and lets the burning tears wash the blood off its face.\n\n<It was alone.>",
